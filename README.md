# UniFraud-GH: Cross-Domain Fraud Detection for Ghana

A multi-domain fraud detection research system covering three financial sectors in Ghana: **credit card transactions**, **mobile money transfers**, and **health insurance claims**. This project explores domain adaptation techniques to transfer fraud knowledge across sectors, addressing the challenge of limited labelled data in any single domain.

Developed as part of a thesis project at Ashesi University.

Financial fraud in Ghana operates across multiple sectors simultaneously. Fraudsters who exploit credit card systems often employ similar behavioural patterns in mobile money and insurance claim fraud. This project builds on that observation by:

1. Labelling health insurance fraud using Ghana NHIA G-DRG tariff compliance rules (Sowah et al., 2019)
2. Engineering domain-specific and universal features across all three sectors
3. Training baseline classifiers (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, Isolation Forest, Autoencoder) per domain
4. Applying three domain adaptation methods: DANN, Subdomain Adaptation with MMD, and HEN
5. Evaluating a stacking ensemble and cross-domain transfer across all six source-target pairs
6. Explaining model decisions using SHAP and LIME

## Domain Adaptation Methods

### DANN - Domain-Adversarial Neural Network
Trains a feature extractor that learns domain-invariant representations by simultaneously optimising a fraud classifier and a domain discriminator with a gradient reversal layer. The adversarial training forces the encoder to produce features that are indistinguishable across source and target domains.

### Subdomain Adaptation with MMD
Clusters transactions into subdomains and minimises Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) between source and target cluster distributions. This is more fine-grained than global domain alignment and handles the heterogeneous fraud patterns across sectors.

### HEN - Hierarchical Ensemble Network
Uses an attention mechanism to weight features by relevance before encoding them, pre-trains on the labelled source domain, then fine-tunes on the (partially labelled) target domain. The attention weights provide built-in interpretability.

---

## Semantic Feature Alignment

A key contribution of this project is the semantic alignment layer that maps domain-specific column names to three universal fraud concepts before cross-domain transfer:

- **Amount Anomaly**: transaction size relative to population distribution
- **Counterparty Risk**: properties of the recipient account, merchant, or healthcare provider
- **Structural Distance**: temporal, geographic, or billing pattern irregularity

This allows the models to exploit common fraud signals across sectors even when raw feature names differ.

---

## Results Summary

All detailed results are saved to `outputs/all_experiment_results.csv` after running notebook 07.

- **Experiment 1**: Within-domain baseline
- **Experiment 2**: Direct cross-domain transfer (no adaptation)
- **Experiment 3**: Domain adaptation (DANN, Subdomain, HEN)
- **Experiment 4**: Universal feature identification
- **Experiment 5**: Stacking ensemble

Statistical validation uses paired t-tests (alpha = 0.05) comparing the ensemble against XGBoost baseline and comparing HEN against DANN and Subdomain Adaptation.

## Evaluation Metrics

Because the three datasets have very different fraud rates, different primary metrics are used:

| Domain | Primary Metric | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| Credit Card | ROC-AUC | 0.52% fraud rate makes F1 unreliable |
| Mobile Money | F1 | Near-balanced dataset |
| Health Insurance | MCC | ~40% fraud rate; MCC is robust to label imbalance |
